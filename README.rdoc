#Rales Engine

Following in the proud tradition of the original Sales Engine (R.I.P.), Rales
Engine parses CSVs, creates database relationships, and provides business
analytics to extract value from the data. However, Rales Engine also goes above
and beyond its predecessor by building out a JSON API that exposes the
Sales Engine's data schema.
